<p>Deleting a Campaign will permanently delete all Ad Groups and Adverts contained within it. All tracking data tied to this Campaign will also be deleted. Phone numbers will be released and made available to use in other Campaigns (meaning that if anyone tries to call these numbers they will not be able to connect). Press "Delete All Data" to proceed.</p>
